* Because the solidity 0.5.13 compiler does not support ABI encoding for
* structs(except with the experimental flag which casts all the values to strings)
* we sometimes return the 'destructured' objects.
* The contract holds a list of input chunk ids (_inChunkIds) and of requested profiles (_profile).
* Each requested profile has an Outstream and each Outstream stores a dictionary of
* proof queues mapped for each input chunk. The proof queues store the proofs & ouput chunks
* submited by miners.
